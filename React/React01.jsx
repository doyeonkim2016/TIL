/*
I.React is an Open Source view library.It is a great tool to render the User Interface of mdern web application

React uses syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JS.
For instance, because JSX is syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actualy write JS directly within JSX. 

ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))

This function call is what places your JSX into REacts' own light weight representation of the DOM.
React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimise updating only specific parts of actual DOM.

II. Create a Complex JSX element
JSX can represent more complex HTML as well.
