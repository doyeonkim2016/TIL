# Greedy Algorithm

## Greedy Problem
---
Given Divisible proble, a strategy that at each stage of the process takes the locally optimal choice is called greedy algorithm.
We stated that we should address a divisible proble: A situdation that can be described as a set of subproblems with the same characteristics.
Most of the time, greedy algorithm will be implemented as a recursive algorithm.



Greedy Algorithms can help you find solutions to a lot of seemingly tough problems. The only problem with them is that you might come up with the correct solution but you might not be able to verify if its the correct one. All the greedy problems share a common property that a local optima can eventually lead to a global minima without reconsidering the set of choices already considered.
