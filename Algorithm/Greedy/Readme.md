# Greedy Algorithm

## Greedy Problem
---
Given Divisible proble, a strategy that at each stage of the process takes the locally optimal choice is called greedy algorithm.
We stated that we should address a divisible proble: A situdation that can be described as a set of subproblems with the same characteristics.
Most of the time, greedy algorithm will be implemented as a recursive algorithm.
