# Introducting Cloud Architecting

---
## Course Objectives

1. Define cloud architecture
2. Describe how to design and evaluate architectures using the AWS well architected Framework
3. Explain best practices for building solutions on AWS
4. Describe how to make informed decision on where to place AWS resources.

### Cloud Architecture

Cloud Architecture is the practice of applying cloud characteristics to a solution that uses cloud services and features to meet 
and organisation's technical needs and business use cases.

- Engage with decision makers to identify the business goals and the capabilities that need improvement
- Ensure Alignment between technology deliverables of a soluton and the business goals.
- Work with delivery teams that are implementing the solution to ensure that the tchnology features are appropriate


### AWS Well Architected Framework is organised into 5 pillars

#### Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performancee Efficiency and Cost Optimisation

1. Security

Addresses the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation startegies.

2. Operational Excelence

Ability to run and monitor systems.
Continuously improve supporting process and procedures (Deploy, Update, Operation)

3. Reliability

Recover quickly from infrastructure or service disruptions
Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand

4.Performance 

Choose Efficient resources and maintain their efficiency as demand changes.
Democratize advanced technologies

5. Cost Optimisation 

Measure Efficiency , Eliminate unneeded expense


### Best Practices for building solutions on AWS

#### Design Tradeoffs 

Select an optimal approach.Tradeoffs can increase the cost and complexity of your architecture.
Thus, the design should be based on empirical data. Need to perform load testing to enusre that the measureable benefit 
is obtained in performance.

1. Enable scalability(1 of 2)

Ensure that your architecture can handle changes in demand.
