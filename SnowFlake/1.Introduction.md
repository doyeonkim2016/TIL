# Snowflake Tutorial

## Introduction to Snowflake : Architecture, and SnowflakeSQL

### What is snowflake?
Cloud based data warehouse - high scalability, accessibility, cost-efficiency and lower management efforts.

#### Row vs Columnar database
Row - data is organised and stored by row by row. Oftenly used in SQL (Mysql, SSMS etc). 
<br>Column - store data by columns (Snowflake, Redshift, Bigquery) -> Faster response times.</br>

Snowflake's columnar data storage model and it's unique architecture enables advanced analytics, and efficient hasndling of data-intensive tasks.

### 1. Storage Layer : Columnar storage
### 2. Compute Layer 
Query execution, virual warehouses which can be scaled up and down. -> Cost effectice
### 3. Cloud Services Layer 
Infrastructure management, Query optimisation, authentication, access control and security

## Snowflake SQL and key concepts
### Snowsight : Snowflake web interface. Worksheets
### DDL 
1. CREATE - TABLE,VIEW<br>
2. ALTER -  TABLE<br>
3. COMMENT - end of the table create statement.

### Staging
Snowflake staging acts as an intermediary storage area. It can be set up either local within snowflake or on external cloud platform.

### DML
1. SHOW - SHOW databases, SHOW TABLES IN DATABASE, SHOW TABLES LIKE , SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE, SHOW COLUMNS, SHOW VIEWS IN DATABASE
2. DESRIBE - DESC OR DESC. Provides in depth description of the table, view
3. INSERT INTO VALUES/ SELECT * FROM ...
4. UPDATE TABLE SET COLUMN WHERE
5. MERGE - Combines data from two tables
6. COPY INTO orders FROM @ my_local_stage FILE_FORMAT

### Data Type Conversion
1. CAST syntax - CAST (orders as timestamp)
2. :: Syntax - source :: data type
3. TO_DATE function

### Functions
1. CONCAT - CONCAT( category , 'string to add')
2. Upper, Lower
3. Date & Time - CUURENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME
4. Extract - Extract Year, month, time from Date Time
5. Group BY + GROUP BY ALL - Group by all columns.

## Advance Snowflake SQL concepts

### JOINS
1. Inner Join
2. Outer Join
3. Natural Join - eliminate duplicate columns, can use right,left,outer join
4. Lateral join - more flexible in writing subquery.

### Query Optimisation
Transforming into more efficient queries - enhance efficiency which achieves faster results, and enhance cost efficiency. 
1. Exploding Joins  - Try to use on
2. Union - removes duplicates, slows down the query. Union all is faster if no duplicates
3. TOP clause reduces query time. Avoid using Select *
4. Filter Early. Apply filters before using joins.

### Handling Semi structured data -JSON
1.PARSE_JSON - returns json object as VARIANT data type
2.OBJECT_CONSTRUCT
3.Nested Object, use : and . 

SELECT
  name,
  categories,
  -- Select WheelchairAccessible from attributes converting it to STRING
  attributes:WheelchairAccessible::STRING AS wheelchair_accessible,
  -- Select Saturday, Sunday from hours converting it to STRING
  (hours:Saturday:STRING IS NOT NULL OR hours:Sunday:STRING IS NOT NULL) AS open_on_weekend
FROM
  yelp_business_data


-- Create CTE dogs_allowed.
WITH dogs_allowed AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM yelp_business_data
  WHERE attributes:DogsAllowed::STRING  NOT ILIKE '%None%'
    -- Filter data where DogsAllowed is True.
  AND attributes:DogsAllowed::STRING = 'True' 
)

, touristy_places AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM yelp_business_data
  WHERE
    attributes:Ambience NOT ILIKE '%None%'
    AND attributes:Ambience IS NOT NULL
    AND attributes:Ambience NOT ILIKE '%u\'%'
    -- Convert Ambience attribute in the attributes columns into valid JSON using PARSE_JSON.
    -- From Valid JSON, fetch the touristy attribute and check if it\'s true when casted to BOOLEAN.
    AND PARSE_JSON(attributes:Ambience):touristy::BOOLEAN = true
)

SELECT
	d.business_id,
    d.name
FROM
dogs_allowed d
JOIN touristy_places t
