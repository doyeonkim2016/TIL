2. Data Lake - Data becomes very messy. Sub- optimal performance for different workload.
3. Lakehouse - Great performance across a;; workloads. Very cost effective for any data workload.

## Core features of Databricks in Lakehouse Platform.
1. Apache Spark <br>
i) Extensible,flexible open-source framework.<br>
ii) Large developer community <br>
iii) High performing <br>
iv) Data bricks optimisations.

2. Databricks Compute

ii) SQL Warehouses - SQL only, BI use cases, Photon 

3. Delta Lake

4. Unity Catalog
Unity Catalog is an open data governance strategy that controls access to all data assets in the Databricks Lakehouse platform.
SQL GRANT, REVOKE statements to control access. Simple interface for governance.
