#Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multiclass classification problems. It is called Naive Bayes or idiot Bayes because the calculations of the probabilities for each class are simplified to make their calculations tractable.

#Separate by Class
# Split the dataset by class values, returns a dictionary

			separated[class_value] = list()
		separated[class_value].append(vector)
