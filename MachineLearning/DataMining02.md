# Data

## Types of Attributes

### 1. Nominal

Meaningless, barely enough to tell one object from another
Examples: ID, Numbers, eye color, zip codes

### 2. Ordinal

Order has meaning
Examples: Rankings ,Grades

### 3. Interval

Difference has meaning
Examples: Calendar dates, temperature in Celsius

### 4. Ratio

ratio has meaning
Examples: Length, time, counts

## Discrete & Continuous Attributes
### Discrete Attribute
has only a finite or countably infinite set of values
often represented as integer variables
Note: binary attributes are special case of discrete attributes

### Continuous Attribute
has real numbers as attribute values
temperature,height or weight
continous attributes are typically represented as floating point variables.

## Data Quality

### Noise and Outliers
Noise refers to modification of origianl values
Cause:
1) Fauly data collection instruments
2) data entry problems
3) data transmission problems
4) technology limitation

Outliers are data objects with characteristics that are considerably different than most of the other data objects in the data set.

### Missing Values

### Duplicate Data

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
Importance -> Data cleaning is the number one problem in dw
handle missing values, identify outliers and smooth noisy data. Correct Inconsistent data
Resolved redudancy caused by data integration

### Aggregation
Combining 2 or more attributes into a single attributes
purpose: 
reduce the number of attributes or objects
More stable data

### Sampling

### Dimensionality Reduction
Avoid curse of dimensionality
Reduce amount of time and memory required by data mining problems.


### Attribute/Variable transformation
