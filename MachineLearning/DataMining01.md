# Data Mining Introductino

## KDD
### KDD(Knowledge Discovery in Databases)

Non trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful knowledge from large amounts of data


## Major Steps of Data Mining(KDD)

### 1. Data Preprocessing
a) Data Integration - combine multiple data sources
b) Data Cleaning - Remove noise and inconsistent data
c) Data Selection - Select task relevant data
d) Data Transformation - Transform/consolidate selected data for further analysis


### 2. Data Mining
a) Data Mining and Machine Learning methods

### 3. Pattern Evaluation (Post Processing)
a) Evaluate and identify truly interesting patterns

### 4. Visualisation



## Data Sources

### 1. Flat files
a) Textual format
b) Extract Useful Knowledge

### 2. Relational DBs
a) Collection of tables, consists of tuples and attributes
b) DBMS facilities queries, data mining tries to achieve deeper knowledge
c) Mine useful knowledge from number of tables.

### 3. Data Warehouse
a)Repository of information
b)transactional dbs
c) Built to support online analysis processing(OLAP), but data mining is deeper than OLAP

### 4. Transactional DBs
a) consists of records where each record represents a transaction

### 5. Advanced DBs
a) Require sophisticated data structures and scalable method
b)Provide fertile ground for applying data mining


## Data Mining Tasks

### Descriptive

#### a) Clustering
#### b) Association Rule Mining
#### c) Sequence Pattern Mining

### Predictive

#### a) Classification
From the training data with class labels, a classification model is learnt to distinguish data instances between different classes.
Model can be represented as classification rules, decision trees, mathematical formulae
Model is used to predict its class labels.

Goal: To ensure that previously unseen records should be assigned class as accurately as possible

#### b) Outlier Detection

#### c) Regression
Used to map data item to real valued prediction variable.

Goal: Predict a value of a given continuous valued variable based on the values of other variables, assuming linear or non linear model of dependency.
** Classification learns a model to predict categorical labels. Whereas, regression learns a model to predict continuous target.
